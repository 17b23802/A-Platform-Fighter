Hi, this is a platform fighter I made for my computing science project. I don't really know how to describe it but I tried to make it have a similar feel to Rivals of Aether, it features original characters from me and friends, random music from freemusicarchive and a heavy focus on 1v1 competitive matches

Even though I've finished the project I still want to maintain and improve the game so there will probably be semi-frequent updates.

Upcoming features:
Improved controller support
Controller menuing, controls and presets
Platforms, multiple stages and a stage select
Fix the easy mode code
Heavily improve the menuing
Add items / power ups
Customisation options / character skins
Tutorial
Continued balance changes
Contunied AI fixing

If I implement everything else:
Support for more platforms - Linux, Mac, Kaboom (depending on how replit handle the removal of the run button)
Online support - I currently don't even know where to start
Heavily overhaul the graphics
